Get a Mentor <br>When I was learning French,</h2>

<p>I came across a method that resulted in the greatest leap in
my speaking abilities. That was having language exchanges
over Skype. I would pair up with a native French speaker
who wanted to learn English. We would spend half an hour
speaking French and half an hour speaking English. We
would both dedicate an hour each week to improving the
language that we were trying to learn. <br>While we were having a conversation in French, he would
correct my pronunciation or grammar and suggest ways
that I could construct my sentences to sound more native.<br>Pair programming is an agile software development
technique that’s based on very similar principles. For
example, a learner and a mentor would sit down at the
same workstation and work on a problem. The learner is in
charge of writing code and the mentor reviews the code
line-by-line as they are written. <br>It can be uncomfortable at first because it’s a bit </p><hr>
<p>embarrassing making mistakes and having them pointed
out to you. But if you have a mentor who is a good teacher
then they will offer you decades of accumulated wisdom
that can lead to massive improvements in your own ability,
all within a few hours. <br>You’ll get to tap into someone who’s had the time to hone
their skills, find efficient ways of doing things and show
you how they program and approach problems.
<br>Good mentors don’t solve your problems, rather they
practice the Socratic method of asking good questions that
get you to think for yourself. If you ask me how to write a
networking call, of course, I can simply type it all out and
get you to copy it. But that doesn’t help you. Instead, if you
show me how you approach the problem and I show you
how I approach the problem then you can learn so much
more than just following a recipe. <br>The next time you encounter a different problem, you can
apply the same approach and start solving it yourself.
Always remember that information is cheap. A century ago,
if I wanted to learn about the causes of disease, I probably
had to be an aristocrat, or chop wood and carry water for a
master and become their apprentice. Nowadays I can
search Google and get my answer in a few seconds.
<br>So don’t get hung up on information. Learn to think
instead. How to approach a problem. How to break down
the problem. How to frame the problem. These skills will
take you much further than simple memorisation and
regurgitation. <br>
But where do you find a mentor? </p><hr>
There are programming related Meetups happening in
almost every city in the world. Go to www.meetup.com and
find one related to a language you’re trying to learn. Attend
the meetups, get to know people. Exchange your expertise
for their expertise. Maybe someone needs an accountant,
maybe someone needs legal advice. Exchange your time for
their time. Don’t say to someone, “will you be my
mentor?”. No one wants to throw away their free time for
some stranger. Instead, offer your help in return for their
help and you’ll be successful in finding a mentor 95% of the
time.
