    <h2>Be accountable to someone.
Show your work.</h2>

  <p>The biggest problem with online coding courses is the lack
of accountability. No doubt there are loads of great Massive
Open Online Courses (MOOCs), such as Coursera, Udacity,
Udemy, Skillshare. But what are the consequences of not
doing your homework or missing a month’s worth of
lectures? Nothing. Nobody cares. <br>Let’s face it, internal motivation is not strong in any of us.
We can always find a reason why we deserve to watch
Netflix and eat ice cream. I can’t even count how many
online courses I’ve signed up to and subsequently not
listened to a single lecture or completed a single piece of
coursework. <br>You need accountability and commitment to learning.
Think back to your university days, would have bothered to
finish that essay at 3 AM if nothing depended on it? Would
you have gone to any of the lectures if you didn’t care about
passing or failing?</p><hr><p>This is why we try to introduce accountability into our
courses. We’ve realised that matching up students with a
buddy helps. Someone else who is a beginner, at the same
level as you who sometimes helps you and other times
needs your help. Sometimes, as people’s learning rates
diverge or if you’re paired up with a lazy bugger, you can
swap it up and get a new buddy. Because this system is
entirely voluntary, there is a degree of self-selection for
people who work well in teams and are motivated by
others. Just as you’re more likely to go to the gym if you
sign up with your partner, you’re more likely to learn if you
have a coding buddy.
<br>So if you’re not on our course then find your own. There’s
plenty of Facebook groups dedicated to those who are
learning to code. There’s an entire subreddit
(r/learnprogramming) dedicated to this, I’m sure you’ll
find like-minded people somewhere online or offline.<br>The next thing I’m going to tell you will be controversial.
We believe that people don’t value things that don’t have
value. This is the reason why Coursera is taking down a
large number of their free courses. They saw that millions
of people were signing up for it but no one was taking any
of the classes let alone completing any of the projects. It
was actually detrimental to students’ learning to offer a
free course. We all have a degree of hoarding tendencies
and it’s very easy to signup for a bunch of stuff that the <br>future you can suffer through. There’s always tomorrow,
she says.
<hr><p>

So if you are driven more by external motivation than
internal, <br>try to use a little bit of financial motivation to
drive your learning. Think about how much a life skill is
worth to you and put your money where your intentions
are. See if you’re engaging with the course content more
with or without the financial commitment. There are
plenty of places where you can pay for something
affordable to motivate yourself to start a regular learning
habit. <br>The final part of this rule is to try and find ways of getting
assessed. Ok, so getting assessed is right up there with
death and taxes in terms of how much people enjoy it. But
when learning anything, it’s always important to get
feedback. You will get an objective assessment of your
current skill level, instead of feeling like an imposter or
brimming with false confidence. Coursera has a system
where the students mark each other’s work. At the App
Brewery, we use Github education to test your code and
look for bugs and problems with your code. But if you’re on
a coding course that doesn't have a system like this, then
it’ll be worth your while to find a code mentor who can
review your code and give you feedback. Only what’s
measured can be improved.
