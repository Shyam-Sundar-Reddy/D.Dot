    <h2>RULE TWELVE:
Break someone else's
code <br>One of the most important
steps to take</h2>

  <p>in order to make the jump from learner coder to a
fully-fledged programmer is understanding how to get
help. Everyone needs help. Everyone, including those
so-called “God Level Programmers”.
<br>But what you do with the help will determine how fast you
progress as a coder. On a site like StackOverflow, it can be
very tempting to just copy and paste the code that someone
has provided. Your program works exactly as you hoped it
would and off you go on your merry programming ways.
This exercise didn’t teach you anything other than code
reliance. Because the next time you encounter the same
problem but in a different situation, that same code
snippet that someone provided may not work anymore.
Then what do you do? You’re stuck.<br>That’s why there’s a rule in programming that says “never
copy paste code that you don’t understand”. So what
should you do when you’re confronted with a block of code
that solves your problem but you have no clue how it
works? Break it down.</p><hr><p>Step 1 - Copy and paste the code into your program. (yes,
yes, I know I just said not to do that, patience, patience).
Step 2 - Make sure that your program or application is
functioning as expected. I.e. confirm that block of code
really did solve your problem.<br>
Step 3 - Delete the copy and pasted block of code line by
line.<br>
Step 4 - Each time you delete a line, check to see what’s
been broken. Does the app still run? What are the error
codes? What has deleting that line of code done to your
program?<br>
Step 5 - Even if you think you know what a line of code
does, delete it any way. The most important task as a
programmer is to always test your assumptions against the
outcome. The most enjoyable feeling as a programmer is
for the real world to validate your assumptions. Do you
know how nice it is when your
boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife says those magical
three words?<br>You were right”.<br>
It’s like that, but better.
 </p><hr><p>Step 6 - Swap some of the lines around. Can the same
functionality be achieved with a different order of lines?
Why were they written in the order they were written in?<br>
By breaking the solution code, line-by-line, you’ll learn and
understand what each line does and why it’s been written.
This is a far better way to use code from other people than
just pasting it in and hoping for the best. Once you
understand why each of those lines was necessary, the next
time you encounter a similar problem, you’ll be able to
tease out the problem and solve it yourself. <br>
Once you’ve mastered breaking code from StackOverflow,
the next resource to target is GitHub. It’s a tool used by
programmers for collaboration but it is also one of the
largest repositories of open source code. <br>
So how can you use it to become a better programmer?
Let’s say that you want to make an Instagram clone. But
unfortunately, you don’t know how to do that. So you head
over to github.com and search “Instagram” or “photo app”. <br>
Inevitably, there will be something written in
Swift/Objective-C/Java that you can download and take a
look at. <br>
Think about the structure of their program. Take a look at <br>
</p><hr>all the classes, the constants, the interplay. Make some
modifications to the code. Does it still work or have you
broken it? Why did you break it? Is there a link that you
didn’t identify? Ask yourself a bunch of questions, learn
through the Socratic method. Tear down the project and
understand how it was built. <br>
When you start getting really good at this, the next thing
you can try is reverse engineering. Find a small project on
GitHub made by a reputable programmer, download the
app. Run it and see all of its functionality. Play around with
it. <br>
Then build it from scratch and once you’re done, compare
your code to their code. Are there efficiency gains that you
could have made? Are there solutions to things you
couldn’t figure out? Now you’re really getting into the big
leagues.
