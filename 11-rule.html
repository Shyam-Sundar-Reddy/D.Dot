    <h2>RULE ELEVEN:
Get into the Habit of
Chunking<br>So you have an awesome
idea.</h2>

<p>But it’s way-way-way too complicated for your current skill
level. What do you do? You join the Chunking Express.<br>
Nope, I’m not talking about the art-house movie. I’m
talking about breaking down your programming problem.<br>
Let’s say that you’re trying to make a robot that can butter
toast. (If anyone is working on one of these I’d happily
fund your Kickstarter!) The robot doesn't know anything
about toast or butter or knives. Believe it or not, it actually
takes pretty sophisticated circuitry in our brains to be able
to achieve something as simple as buttering a slice of toast.
(This is probably why I can’t seem to do it without coffee).<br>So creating a robot that does all of that autonomously is
really complicated and difficult. But as we’re good
programmers, we can do some chunking and break down
the problem.<br>
The robot doesn’t really need to know what is toast and </p><hr><p>what is butter, we’re not making Skynet here, so let’s just
stick to the practical things. There are three things we need
the robot to do:
Pick up and arrange the piece of toast in the ideal buttering
position.<br>
Pick up a serving of butter.
Place butter on toast with decent coverage (this is the part I
find most difficult).
Next, you break each module down even further.<br> In the
process, you can think about alternate ways of solving the
problem. For example, does the robot need to “spread” the
butter? Or can it just melt the butter onto the toast? Does it
need to learn to pick up a knife? Or can it have some sort of
inbuilt knife-arm, like some sort of prison shiv pirate?
The more that you break down problems and define the
issue that you’re trying to solve, the easier it is to package
your code into bite-sized chunks.<br> The simpler the chunk,
the easier it is to tackle.
So the next time that you’re trying to make that “cross
between Snapchat and Evernote”, remember to break
down the problem into solvable chunks. </p>
