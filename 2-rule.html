<h2>Code for a Purpose</h2>
<p>  When I first started learning
how to code,
<br />there were countless times when I picked it up then gave
up, again and again. This is a common story amongst
self-taught coders. Looking back, after teaching so many
students, I finally realise what’s going on. A lot of
beginners start learning to code by picking an arbitrary
language and following along with a bunch of tutorials.
Copying code, line by line, sometimes writing code to work
out prime numbers, other times to find all the even
numbers.<br />But you know what? I can find prime numbers a lot faster
by Googling for it and picking out even numbers is not all
that interesting.<br />Here’s the truth. If you are learning to code for the sake of
learning to code, it’ll be pretty difficult for you to get good
at it. Skills that require a lot of time to hone, like
programming, will eat into your pool of internal
motivation. Something from within that makes you forget
to eat and sleep. I can honestly say that coding on my own
projects is one of the most enjoyable things I do.
<br /></p><hr />
<p>It combines logical thinking with creativity, and at the end,
you will have made something. In most cases, something
that the world has never seen. Something that could make
your life easier or more enjoyable. Something that could
make loads of people's lives easier and more enjoyable. It’s
like making a crazy-beautiful custom motorbike in your
garage, without needing the garage or spending a cent on
the components.<br />This is what motivates most people. The creating part. The
making part. So I urge you to start learning to code by
following a tutorial that makes something, anything.<br />Of course, it’s unlikely that at the beginning, you'll be able
to code up Clash of Clans or League of Legends. But you’ll
be able to make something interesting. It could be a dice
game or a flash-card app. But as long at the end of the
tutorial, you’ll have made something you can use and play
with, then you’ll be far more motivated to code to the end. <br />
During all our courses, we always tell our students to think
up a simple app that they want to make. Something that
uses the skills that they’ve learned during the course but
will also stretch them a little because they have to find out
how to include some new functionality. <br />
We had a student who went on to make an app that wakes<br /><hr /><p>

them up a minute earlier every day to ease the transition to
an earlier waking time. There’s a student who made a
custom slideshow app as a mother’s day present. Someone
else made an app that is a timer for making perfect steaks
based on their weight and thickness.<br />There are no limits on your imagination. It will be difficult
when you start working on your own app because there are
no step-by-step instructions, but it will also bring about the
biggest improvement in your coding ability.
