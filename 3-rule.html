    <h2>RULE THREE:
There is No “Perfect”
Language to Learn</h2>

<p><strong>Whenever I do large talks,</strong><br />
  there will always be one person who asks me “which
  programming language should I start learning first”? <br />
  There is this common perception that somewhere out there
  lies a perfect language for beginner programmers. Some
  argue it’s Python, some say it’s Javascript. <br />
  But I say they’re all wrong.
  A programming language is simply a tool. It is no different
  from any other tool in your hardware box. If you want to
  hammer a nail, you should be using a hammer. If you want
  to fix your water pipes, you’ll probably need a spanner.  <br />
  Yes, it’s possible to hammer in a nail using the side of the
  spanner and the same programming language can be used
  to solve different types of problems. The carpenter will tell
  you that his favourite tool is a hammer and the plumber
  will say it’s the spanner, but it still doesn’t make it the “best
  tool to fix things”.<br />A web developer will tell you that JavaScript is the best
language to learn for a beginner. A statistician will advise
you that you’ll be best served with the R programming
language. But at the end of the day, all that matters is what
you are trying to do with your tool. If you want to make iOS
apps, then learn Swift. If you want to make websites, you’ll
need JavaScript. <br />
But the good news is the core programming concepts:
loops, conditionals, functions, etc. they’re all the same. The
difference is mostly syntactical.<br />
In English, we have werewolves, in German they have
Werwölfe. It’s still the same shirt-ripping mammal that
comes out during a full moon, it’s just spelt differently. <br />
Printing to the console in Swift:
print(“Hello Werewolves”)<br />
Printing to the console in Java:
println(“Hello Werwölfe”)
So, decide on the task that you are trying to accomplish,
then pick the best tool for that task </p>
