<p>I thought the way to learn to code was to read a whole
bunch of books. I bought books on C++, C#, Java and
loads more. You name it, I had it. But they didn’t do very
much other than make me confused.
I read. I highlighted. I forgot. I fell asleep.
Books are good as references. If you want to dive deep into
delegates and protocols, read the chapter on that. But if
you want to learn, make something.</p><hr>
<p>But what do you make?
Lacking in ideas? Be a copycat. Make your own notepad,
make your own MSPaint, make your own piano. If you’re
into games, make minesweeper, make Tetris, make Flappy
Bird. Not only will they be sort of useful, but they’ll also be
the perfect opportunity for you to figure out how to do
things and get experience in finding help. Something that
is brand new to the world like holographic smartphon projections, no one will be able to help you with. By
making copycat apps or programs, you’ll be treading in the
path that many have walked before you. This way you
maximise the chances that someone will be able to offer
you help and advice when you get stuck.</p>
