    <h2>RULE EIGHT
Keep Learning <br>Being a good programmer is
a bit like being Madonna.</h2>

<p>Don’t run out and buy your cone-shaped bras just yet.
What I mean is programming will keep evolving. In order
to stay relevant, you have to keep reinventing yourself.  <br>
There’s always new trends, new technologies and new
languages. Great programmers relish learning new things,
even if it means they become a beginner again.
The world will keep moving, if you stay in one place, you’ll
eventually be left behind. <br> I know programmers who never
learnt anything else apart from Fortran. I know
Objective-C programmers who can’t persuade themselves
to make the leap and learn Swift, even though Apple is
telling developers that Objective-C will be phased out. We
all know that Apple never makes threats that they don’t
carry out, just look at the optical drive (and soon the
headphone jack?)<br>Don’t be the optical drive. Or rather, don’t be the laptop
that’s still trying to play CDs. If your needs change, learn to <br>use a new tool. Keep learning, stay relevant.
Are you a web developer who always wanted to get into
mobile development?<br><hr><p> Pick a platform and learn iOS or
Android. Are you a front-end developer who is tempted by
the full-stack? Pick up web development with Node. If you
already understand the core programming concepts,
picking up a few more languages will be a lot easier than
starting from scratch. <br>
“Learn x in y minutes” is a great resource for existing
programmers to learn new programming languages. Check
out their resources here: learnxinyminutes.com
