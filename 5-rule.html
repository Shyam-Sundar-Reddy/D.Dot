<h2>RULE FIVE
It’s Ok to Not Know</h2>

<p><br> Software engineers are
purportedly the profession
that has the largest
population of Imposter
Syndrome sufferers <br>Imposter Syndrome is a psychological phenomenon where
people feel like frauds and massively underestimate their
own skills and abilities.   <hr><img  src="images/tt.png" alt="tt-img">Programmers tend to be self-critical and constantly feel
that everyone else is better at programming than they.
If you’ve ever felt this way, you’re not alone, as studies
show that a massive 70 percent of people have imposter
syndrome.<br>I recently saw a post on the Q&A site Quora where
somebody asked: “Would I get fired at Google (or another
big tech firm if I got caught using StackOverflow as a
reference?” <br>
He got a bunch of really great answers from engineers
working at Google, Amazon and other major tech
companies. Anybody who has worked as a software
engineer will tell you that not looking at references is far
more frowned upon. I challenge you to find a single Google
programmer who has not used Stack Overflow. (If you’re
not familiar, StackOverflow is a collaborative Q&A site for
programmers).<br></p><hr><p>
A lot of new programmers are afraid that by checking
references and asking people for help, they will out
themselves as a fraud who doesn’t know to code. <br>Nobody
can hold all the relevant information in their head.For example, this is the name of an iOS method:<br>
- (id)initWithBitmapDataPlanes:(unsigned char **)planes pixelsWide:(NSInteger)width
pixelsHigh:(NSInteger)height bitsPerSample:(NSInteger)bps
samplesPerPixel:(NSInteger)spp hasAlpha:(BOOL)alpha isPlanar:(BOOL)isPlanar
colorSpaceName:(NSString *)colorSpaceName
bitmapFormat:(NSBitmapFormat)bitmapFormat bytesPerRow:(NSInteger)rowBytes
bitsPerPixel:(NSInteger)pixelBits;<br>It’s almost 400 characters!
In iOS programming, there are over 800 classes, 9000
methods and growing. In web development, there’s a new
framework every week. No one will expect you to be able to
remember the code. This is the precise reason why we are
programmers, we can get the computer to do the boring
stuff for us. For example, the code for recording sound is
only a short search away, why would you need to memorise
it?<br>The skill that most employers look for when recruiting is
the ability to think. Knowledge is valued in a world where
information is hard to come by. In the 1800s, only the rich
had access to good books and good teachers. Now,
everyone has all the information they had and more at the
tap of a mouse. Information is losing value, the ability to
think is the stock to buy. So don’t be afraid to search, ask
on StackOverflow or find resources to help you solve your <br>issues. The best programmers do it.
The skill you need to hone is in asking good questions and
understanding the answer. There is no point in
copy-pasting code from a StackOverflow answer if you
have no clue how it works.</p><hr /> <p>Because StackOverflow works
on a reputation system, it’s in their interest to be as clear as
possible in their answer to be marked as correct and collect
upvotes.<br>
In most cases, it doesn’t make sense to start searching
StackOverflow whenever you get stuck. The first option
should always be trying to figure it out yourself. So your
program doesn’t do what you expected it to, but before I
typed the last 3 lines of code, it was working fine. So let’s
figure out what in those last 3 lines broke my app?<br>If you really can’t figure it out, start with Google. Search for
your query or if you have a bug paste the error codes and
the error message. The chances are that as a beginner, your
programming woes will be very common, and somebody
might have even taken the time to write a clear and concise
tutorial to help you understand your bug. As you grow
more skilled in programming, the problems you’ll
encounter get more and more obscure, but hopefully, if you
followed the other 11 rules, you will also be a more capable
programmer and figure it out yourself or know exactly
where to get help.<br>The other reason why you should start with Google is that
StackOverflow’s search algorithm organises questions and
answers by recency and not popularity. A lot of the
problems you will encounter while starting out will have
been asked and answered years ago but are still massively
popular.<br>So ask wisely and you will reap the benefits from the
community. One day when you yourself become a code
master, you’ll be giving back to that same community and
helping the next generation of programmers.
