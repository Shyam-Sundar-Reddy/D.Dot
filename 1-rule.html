<h2>Learning to code is a bit like going to the gym.</h2>
<p>Even if you max out and spend a whole weekend at the
gym, you will not see a visible difference in your body. The
more regularly you learn to code, the more likely it is that
you’ll start seeing your ripped coding muscles. (The
irony is not lost on me).<br />But the problem is where do you find the time? Between
working your full-time job, spending time with your family
and life admin, when are you supposed to sit down and
practice this “daily coding”?<br />While I was working as a doctor, I spent about 12 hours at
the hospital, 1-hour commuting and approximately 2 hours
on general life-sustaining stuff, such as eating. So that left
me with only 9 hours remaining in my day. Theoretically, 2
hours could be allocated to coding practice and 7 hours on
sleep. But there is nothing more difficult than trying to
convince your work-saturated brain to sit down and learn
when you could be watching Game of Thrones with a tub of
ice cream.
<br /><hr />.
But then I found a trick.<br />
As humans, we have a lot of inertia. This can be bad for us -
I’m looking at you, “24” box set. However, we can also turn
it to our advantage. I found that once I started coding and
making things, I got so absorbed into the project that I no
longer cared about TV, food or sleep. There were quite a
few weekends when I coded until sunrise.<br />
So how do we take advantage of this inertia?<br />First, you must understand that task-switching is very
difficult. It requires a lot of motivation. If as soon as you
get home, you slump on the sofa and switch on the TV,
you’ve already lost that evening. This is because the
amount of motivation required to task-switch and do
something not driven by evolution like eating or sleeping is
a Herculean task. <br />This is why the moment you enter the door and change to a
new environment is the most crucial. If at this moment,
you tell yourself that you are just going to do 20 minutes of
coding practice, you will most likely succeed and use your
inertia to end up learning for an hour or more. No brain
will perceive a 20-minute task as a lot of effort and you end
up tricking your brain to take advantage of your evening. <hr />Learning to code is a bit like
going to the gym.
The next step is to develop a habit. Research suggests that
to develop a new habit, you have to carry out the task daily
for a month. I’ve used this next trick for loads of different
things, from exercising to coding, it invariably works like a
charm. To preface this trick, I want you to imagine a wall
with five paintings hanging on it, four of which are
perfectly aligned, perfectly horizontal, but one is crooked.
<br />Now really imagine it, is there a part of you that wants to
fix it? <br />Now let’s imagine a monthly calendar with boxes
representing individual days. If you nurture that new habit
on a particular day, then you make a line through that day.
If you continue your streak the next day then you extend
that line and so forth. There is something about not
breaking a continuous line that motivates most people to
continue to develop a habit. As strange as it sounds, there
are many times when I would have given up, but was
compelled to continue because of a long, continuous line.<br /></p></div>
