    <h2>When you see Hollywood
movies about programmers,</h2>
  <img  src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT8qB2HYA1vVSxooSY/giphy.gif" width="600" height="300" />
  <p>they’re usually sat in front of a laptop, mashing the
keyboard like they’re in some sort of high-stakes “smash
the mole” game.
When you see real programmers working. They tend to
look like this:</p>
  <img  src="images/dd.png" alt="dd-img">
    <p>Yep, that’s right. No typing. Just staring. A lot of staring.<br>In a company, people tend to complain that the
programmers are always playing foosball or doing
something else that doesn’t look like work. People might
not be able to tell, but they are in fact working. <br>
When you see them enjoying their foosball game, laughing
and joking, they’re probably suffering inside. For there’s a
bug, there’s always a bug. Or there’s something mysterious
about their code that they can’t work out. Maybe the code
is working perfectly, but unexpectedly (programmers don’t
like anything unexpected by the way). Like if they just
typed out a thousand lines in one go，and unexpectedly
there are no errors.</p><hr>

<p>Other people might not understand, but in these
situations, it’s almost always worth stepping away from
your code and giving it some time and distance.
Do you have a bug in your code that you can’t work out? <br>
Sleep on it, play foosball, go for a walk. In 9 out of 10 cases,
the solution will become apparent. In the remaining 1 out
of 10 cases, you’re just screwed.
This may sound unintuitive, but my advice is always to
code less, think more. <br>Once the poorly thought-out code is
written and brought into the world, you’ll inevitably have
to go back and comb through your code, line-by-line,
refactoring and deleting things. This is always a painful
experience.
So remember, the easiest code to get rid of is the code that
was never written. </p>
